<h1>Pivotal CF - Spring Boot / Spring Data JPA / Thymeleaf with Bootstrap demo</h1>

The following demo is based on the Spring Boot Albums Demo below but written using Kotlin Classes rather then Java Classes

https://github.com/papicella/PivotalSpringBootJPA

Kotlin is a functional language developed by the JetBrains guys. Its main benefits are:
 - Conciseness of code
 - Code safety - Null safety by not allowing nulls values unless one specifies variables to be null.
 - Interoptability - 100% Java interop.
 - Ease of use and reduced learning curve
 - Great tooling - As support in Intellij Idea is brilliant
